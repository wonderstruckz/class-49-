-  In markdown, we used symbols to tell how we wanted to format text content. In HTML, we use tags to tell the computer how we want to display the content. First, we write the tag <!DOCTYPE HTML> to tell the computer that this is going to be an HTML page. This informs the browser that it is going to read an HTML page. This is a must do for all HTML pages. All our HTML content comes inside the opening <html> tag and closing </html> tag. Inside <html> tags, we can have <head> tags and <body> tags. 

- Inside <head> tags, we store information about the page. Inside <body> tags we write content which is displayed on the web page. Indentations are also followed while writing html to keep everything organized. For example, we can write the title of our page inside <head> tags. 

- It is displayed at the top of the browser when you open the web page. To tell the computer that it is a title, we enclose it under <title> tags.
- We use <h1> tags to create a BIG header. <h2>, <h3>, <h4> tags could be used to create SMALLER headers.
- We use <a> tag to create hyperlinks. Let's create two hyperlinks - Projects and About Me.
- <a> tag has an attribute called 'href' (hypertext reference) which is used to point the tag to other pages. Guide the student to use 'href' attribute to point it to hyperlinks.
